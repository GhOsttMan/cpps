          h4 Is everything on this site 100% accurate?
          p Of course not. It's written by a human(me), so there is bound to be errors. Some of the codes I have given are not even tested. Same goes for the hints. Do not assume everything you read to be true/correct. Use your own judgment and logic to decide whether the facts given on the site is right or wrong.

          h4 Why isn't there any comment/forum section? I want to discuss stuffs.
          p There are already plenty of places to discuss stuffs. Creating another location will simply dilute the whole thing.

          p If you have any question about any particular problem, then it is better to go its corresponding online judge and discuss it on their forum.

          p If you have question about some article on this site unrelated to any online judge, then please find some other place ( facebook group, codeforces, topcoder, codechef ) to discuss them. That will give me free publicity :)

          p If you want to discuss technical stuffs like mistakes in artcle/code, broken link/css or any kind of bugs, then we have <a href='https://github.com/forthright48/cpps/issues'>Github</a> for that.
